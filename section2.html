        <h3>Challenges in Big Data</h3>
        One of the key challenges in Big Data Development is ensuring data quality and reliability. With the massive amount of data being generated, it is essential to implement data validation and cleansing processes to eliminate errors, inconsistencies, and outliers that could affect the accuracy of analysis results.
        <br>
        Some of the Big Data challenges are:<br>
        <br>
        <b>Sharing and Accessing Data:</b>
        <li>Perhaps the most frequent challenge in big data efforts is the inaccessibility of data sets from external sources.</li>
        <li>Sharing data can cause substantial challenges.</li>
        <li>It include the need for inter and intra- institutional legal documents.</li>
        <li>Accessing data from public repositories leads to multiple difficulties.</li>
        <li>It is necessary for the data to be available in an accurate, complete and timely manner because if data in the companies information system is to be used to make accurate decisions in time then it becomes necessary for data to be available in this manner.</li>
        
        <br>
        <b>Privacy and Security:</b>
        <li>It is another most important challenge with Big Data. This challenge includes sensitive, conceptual, technical as well as legal significance.</li>
        <li>Most of the organizations are unable to maintain regular checks due to large amounts of data generation. However, it should be necessary to perform security checks and observation in real time because it is most beneficial.</li>
        <li>There is some information of a person which when combined with external large data may lead to some facts of a person which may be secretive and he might not want the owner to know this information about that person.</li>
        <li>Some of the organization collects information of the people in order to add value to their business. This is done by making insights into their lives that they’re unaware of.</li>
    
        <br>
        <b>Analytical Challenges:</b>
        <li>There are some huge analytical challenges in big data which arise some main challenges questions like how to deal with a problem if data volume gets too large?</li>
        <li>Or how to find out the important data points?</li>
        <li>Or how to use data to the best advantage?</li>
        <li>There are two techniques through which decision making can be done:
            <ul><li>Either incorporate massive data volumes in the analysis.</li>
           <li> Or determine upfront which Big data is relevant.</li></ul>
        </li>
